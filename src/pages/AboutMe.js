        <p>
          Ever since I built my first computer when I was 12 years old I have been obsessed with hardware and software development.  I began developing web applications shortly after that, using the limited self-study resources available online in the early 2000's.  Throughout that time I became extensively knowledgeable not only with the development of web based applications but with graphic design using Photoshop and Illustrator, 3d modeling and CAD using a variety of the most popular design suits, electrical engineering and electromagnetism concepts while designing and manufacturing my own printed circuit boards and winding my own transformers, and embedded bare metal software design including writing my own firmware in C , C++ and arduino.  After years of self study, I decided to further my education specifically in regards to web development and enroll at Lambda, a 9 month full stack coding boot camp.  While studying at Lambda I came up with the idea to develop my own online platform to share some of the knowledge I have picked up over the years in the form of articles that I write, open source projects that I have worked on, and articles written by others that I have found useful.
